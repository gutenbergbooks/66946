<h1>SUMMER MORNING.</h1>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Morning</span> again breaks through the mines of Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shakes her jewelled kirtle on the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with rosy gold. Aside are driven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The vassal clouds, which bow as she draws nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And catch her scattered gems of orient dye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pearlèd-ruby which her pathway strews;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Argent and amber, now thrown useless by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The uncoloured clouds wear what she doth refuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For only once does Morn her sun-dyed garments use.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No print of sheep-track yet hath crushed a flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The spider’s woof with silvery dew is hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it was beaded ere the daylight hour:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The hookèd bramble just as it was strung,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When on each leaf the Night her crystals flung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hurried off, the dawning to elude;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before the golden-beakèd blackbird sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ere the yellow-brooms, or gorses rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had bared their armèd heads in lowly gratitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From Nature’s old cathedral sweetly ring<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The wild-bird choirs&mdash;burst of the woodland band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green-hooded nuns, who ’mid the blossoms sing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their leafy temple, gloomy, tall, and grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pillared with oaks, and roofed with Heaven’s own hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! how the anthem rolls through arches dun:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Morning again is come to light the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great world’s Comforter, the mighty Sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has yoked his golden steeds, the glorious race to run.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those dusky foragers, the noisy rooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have from their green high city-gates rushed out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rummage furrowy fields and flowery nooks;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On yonder branch now stands their glossy scout.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As yet no busy insects buzz about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fairy thunder o’er the air is rolled:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The drooping buds their crimson lips still pout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those stars of earth, the daisies white, unfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon the buttercups will give back “gold for gold.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Hark! hark! the lark” sings ’mid the silvery blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Behold her flight, proud man! and lowly bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seems the first that does for pardon sue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As though the guilty stain which lurks below<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had touched the flowers that drooped above her brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she all night slept by the daisies’ side;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now she soars where purity doth flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where new-born light is with no sin allied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pointing with her wings Heaven-ward our thoughts would guide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In belted gold the bees with “merry march”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through flowery towns go sounding on their way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pass the streakèd woodbine’s sun-stained arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And onward glide through streets of sheeted May,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor till they reach the summer-roses stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where maiden-buds are wrapt in dewy dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drowsy through breathing back the new-mown hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rolls its fragrance o’er the fringèd streams,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mirrors in which the Sun now decks his quivering beams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Uprise the lambs, fresh from their flowery slumber,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(The daisies they pressed down rise from the sod;)&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He guardeth them who every star doth number,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who called His Son a lamb,&mdash;“the Lamb of God;”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And for His sake withdrew th’ uplifted rod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding each cloud turn to a silvery fleece,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The imaged flock for which our Shepherd trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The paths of sorrow, that we might find peace:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those emblems of his love will wave till time shall cease.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the far sky leans the old ruined mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through its rent sails the broken sunbeams glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gilding the trees that belt the lower hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the old thorns which on its summit grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only the reedy marsh that sleeps below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its dwarf bushes, is concealed from view;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now a struggling thorn its head doth show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another half shakes off the smoky blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just where the dusty gold streams through the heavy dew:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And there the hidden river lingering dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You scarce can see the banks which round it lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That withered trunk, a tree, or shepherd seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just as the light or fancy strikes the eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even the very sheep, which graze hard by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So blend their fleeces with the misty haze,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They look like clouds shook from the unsunned sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere morning o’er the eastern hills did blaze:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vision fades as they move further on to graze.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A chequered light streams in between the leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which on the greensward twinkle in the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep-voiced thrush his speckled bosom heaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And like a silver stream his song doth run,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down the low vale, edgèd with fir-trees dun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little bird now hops beside the brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“Peaking” about like an affrighted nun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever as she drinks doth upward look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twitters and drinks again, then seeks her cloistered nook.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What varied colours o’er the landscape play!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The very clouds seem at their ease to lean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole earth to keep glad holiday.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The lowliest bush that by the waste is seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hath changed its dusky for a golden green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In honour of this lovely Summer Morn:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rutted roads did never seem so clean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no dust upon the wayside thorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For every bud looks out as if but newly born.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A cottage girl trips by with side-long look,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Steadying the little basket on her head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where a plank bridges the narrow brook<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She stops, to see her fair form shadowèd.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The stream reflects her cloak of russet red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below she sees the trees and deep-blue sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flowers which downward look in that clear bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very birds which o’er its brightness fly:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She parts her loose-blown hair, then wondering passes by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now other forms move o’er the footpaths brown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In twos and threes; for it is Market-day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond those hills stretches a little town,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thitherward the rustics bend their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Crossing the scene in blue, and red, and grey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by green hedge-rows, now by oak-trees old,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As they by stile or thatchèd cottage stray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peep through the rounded hand, and you’ll behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such gems as Morland drew, in frames of sunny gold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A ladened ass, a maid with wicker maun’,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A shepherd lad driving his lambs to sell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaudy-dressed girls move in the rosy dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Women whose cloaks become the landscape well,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Farmers whose thoughts on crops and prizes dwell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old man with his cow and calf draws near.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Anon you hear the Village Carrier’s bell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then does his grey old tilted cart appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving so slow, you think he never will get there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They come from still green nooks, woods old and hoary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The silent work of many a summer night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere those tall trees attained their giant glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or their dark tops did tower that cloudy height:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They come from spots which the grey hawthorns light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where stream-kissed willows make a silvery shiver.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For years their steps have worn those footpaths bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which wind along the fields and by the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makes a murmuring sound, a “ribble-bibble” ever.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A troop of soldiers pass with stately pace,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their early music wakes the village street:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through yon white blinds peeps many a lovely face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smiling&mdash;perchance unconsciously how sweet!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One does the carpet press with blue-veined feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not thinking how her fair neck she exposes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But with white foot timing the drum’s deep beat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when again she on her pillow dozes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreams how she’ll dance that tune ’mong Summer’s richest roses.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So let her dream, even as beauty should!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let the white plumes athwart her slumbers sway!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should I steep their swaling snow in blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or bid her think of battle’s grim array?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Truth will too soon her blinding star display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like a fearful comet meet her eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet how peaceful they pass on their way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How grand the sight as up the hill they rise!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will not think of cities reddening in the skies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How sweet those rural sounds float by the hill!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The grasshopper’s shrill chirp rings o’er the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jingling sheep-bells are but seldom still,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The clapping gate closes with hollow bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There’s music in the church-clock’s measured sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ring-dove’s song, how breeze-like comes and goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now here, now there, it seems to wander round:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red cow’s voice along the upland flows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bass the brindled bull from the far meadow lows.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Cuckoo! cuckoo!” ah! well I know thy note,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those summer-sounds the backward years do bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Memory’s locked-up barque once more afloat:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They carry me away to life’s glad spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To home, with all its old boughs rustleìng.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis a sweet sound! but now I feel not glad;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I miss the voices which were wont to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on the hills I roamed, a happy lad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Cuckoo!” it is the grave&mdash;not thee&mdash;that makes me sad.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tell me, ye sages, whence these feelings rise,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sorrowful mornings on the darkened soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glimpses of broken, bright, and stormy skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O’er which this earth&mdash;the heart&mdash;has no control?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why does the sea of thought thus backward roll?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memory’s the breeze that through the cordage raves,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ever drives us on some home-ward shoal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if she loved the melancholy waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, murmuring shore-ward break, over a reef of graves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hark how the merry bells ring o’er the vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now near, remote, or lost, just as it blows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red cock sends his voice upon the gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the thatched grange his answering rival crows:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The milkmaid o’er the dew-bathed meadow goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her tucked-up kirtle ever holding tight;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now her song rings through the green hedge-rows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her milk-kit hoops glitter like silver bright:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear her lover singing somewhere out of sight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where soars that spire, our rude forefathers prayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thither they came, from many a thick-leaved dell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Year after year, and o’er those footpaths strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When summoned by the sounding Sabbath bell,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For in those walls they deemed that God did dwell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still they sleep within that bell’s deep sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yon Spire doth here of no distinction tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er rich and poor, marble, and earthly mound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Monument of all,&mdash;it marks one common ground.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">See yonder smoke, before it curls to Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mingles its blue amid the elm-trees tall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrinking like one who fears to be forgiven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So on the earth again doth prostrate fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ’mid the bending green each sin recall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now from their beds the cottage-children rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roused by some early playmate’s noisy bawl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, on the door-step standing, rub their eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretching their little arms, and gaping at the skies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The leaves “drop, drop,” and dot the crisped stream<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So quick, each circle wears the first away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far out the tufted bulrush seems to dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to the ripple nods its head alway;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The water-flags with one another play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowing to every breeze that blows between,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While purple dragon-flies their wings display:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The restless swallow’s arrowy flight is seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dimpling the sunny wave, then lost amid the green.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The boy who last night passed that darksome lane,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Trembling at every sound, and pale with fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shook when the long leaves talked to the rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And tried to sing, his sinking heart to cheer;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hears now no brook wail ghost-like on his ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No dead-man’s groan in the black-beetle’s wing:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But where the deep-dyed butterflies appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the flowers like folded pea-blooms swing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With napless hat in hand he after them doth spring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the far sky the distant landscape melts,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like pilèd clouds tinged with a darker hue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the wood which yon high upland belts<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Looks like a range of clouds, of deeper blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One withered tree bursts only on the view,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bald bare oak, which on the summit grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(And looks as if from out the sky it grew:)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tree has borne a thousand wintry snows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seen unnumbered mornings gild its gnarled boughs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yon weather-beaten grey old finger-post<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stands like Time’s land-mark pointing to decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very roads it once marked out are lost:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The common was encroached on every day<br /></span>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
